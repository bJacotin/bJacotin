## **About Me**

Hello! My name is Bastien Jacotin, and I am an 18-year-old student currently studying Information Technology at the IUT in Limoges. I have a strong passion for programming and have been honing my skills in various languages and projects. My journey in coding started with Python, and I have developed several mini-games to showcase my abilities.

My soft-skills are : 
-French ( Native ) ; English (B2) ; Spanish (B1) ; Greek (A2)
-Communication
-TeamWork

## **Projects**

## **Guessing Game**

One of my first projects was a simple guessing game. The program selects a random number, and the player has to guess what it is. This project helped me understand the basics of input/output operations and control structures in Python.


## **Matchstick Game**

I also created a matchstick game where players take turns to pick 1 to 3 matchsticks, and the player forced to take the last matchstick loses. This project was a great exercise in implementing game logic and turn-based mechanics.


## **Tic-Tac-Toe**

I developed a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to compete. This project involved creating a game board, handling user input, and checking for win conditions. It improved my understanding of arrays and conditional statements.


## **Connect Four**

My most ambitious project so far is a Connect Four game. Players drop their discs into a grid, and the first to connect four discs in a row wins. This project challenged me to think about more complex algorithms and data structures.

## **Scrabble**

The biggest thing I developped in team. Using Java with JavaFX to developp the ScrabbleGame. We used some complex algorithms to achieve.
